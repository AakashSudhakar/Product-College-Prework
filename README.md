### PC Prework

Welcome to the Product College!

During the first week of the Product College, you will take a few tests to see if you can skip some initial classes. You may already possess the skills and knowledge to "test out" of these classes. Please review and complete the following prework.

By completing this prework, you will accelerate your time becoming a software engineer, and can even make it so your can graduate from the Product College sooner. If you do not complete this prework, you will not be "in trouble" but you might be discouraged by being less prepared than other fellows.
